Overview:
The project comprises three Python scripts: main.py, config.py, and openaitest.py, collectively forming an AI assistant named Jarvis. Jarvis is designed to respond to voice commands, utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3 model for natural language processing.

File Descriptions:

main.py:

Voice-activated AI assistant incorporating SpeechRecognition and OpenAI's GPT-3.
Functionalities include web browsing, music playback, time reporting, application launching, and chat interactions.
Responses are stored in a chat history, and OpenAI responses can be saved in a directory named "Openai".
Specific prompts trigger OpenAI responses, enhancing the chat interaction.
config.py:

Configuration file containing the placeholder for the OpenAI API key.
Users are prompted to replace the placeholder with their actual OpenAI API key.
openaitest.py:

Demonstrates the use of OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate an email resignation template.
Sends a prompt requesting an email for resignation and prints the detailed email structure provided by GPT-3.
Project Workflow:

Voice Interaction:

Jarvis listens to voice commands using SpeechRecognition.
Commands trigger various functionalities, such as opening websites, playing music, and interacting in a chat-like manner.
Natural Language Processing:

OpenAI's GPT-3 is employed for natural language understanding and generation.
The openaitest.py script showcases GPT-3's ability to generate specific text, such as an email resignation template.
Configuration:

The config.py file holds the OpenAI API key, ensuring secure and customizable integration.
Project Usage:

Users can interact with Jarvis through voice commands for diverse tasks, benefitting from OpenAI's language capabilities for dynamic responses.
The OpenAI API key can be configured in config.py to enable seamless integration with the GPT-3 model.
Note:

Users are encouraged to replace the OpenAI API key placeholder in config.py with their actual key for the project to function correctly.
This project amalgamates voice recognition, natural language processing, and AI-driven responses to create an interactive and versatile AI assistant.
